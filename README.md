# Video Games Sales Trend
Leveraging data from Kaggle.com and utilizing Power BI, I developed a comprehensive analysis of the global gaming industry. The project provides valuable insights into regional sales distribution, platform and genre-specific sales performance, and category hierarchies.

What started as a small niche has now grown into a multi-billion-dollar industry that spans the globe, reaching people of all ages and genders. Video games are no longer just a hobby—they’ve become a powerful cultural and economic force.

The USA is the biggest consumer and producer of video games, leading with 58.78% of the market, followed in second place by the European Union at 23.23% and Japan at 13.18%.

The PlayStation 2 leads the platform category, achieving the highest number of console sales as well as game sales, reaching an impressive 9.78 billion units sold. In second place we have another Sony console, the PlayStation 3 at 7.24 billion, followed by Xbox X360 at 6.51 billion units.

In the genre category, there is a close battle between action, role-playing, and simulation games. Shooters and racing games have gained a significant margin over the past years, with sports-related games following close behind.
